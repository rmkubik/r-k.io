        A list of the equipment that I use in my home office:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mouse:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S395RWD"
            >Logitech MX Master 3</a
          >. I almost love this mouse. The horizontal scroll wheel is great.
          However, my pinky and ring fingers are smooshed together when holding
          the mouse. This has caused some discomfort for me so I do not solely
          use this mouse anymore. I've been switching between this mouse and my
          MX Vertical.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mouse:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FNJB8TT"
            >Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse</a
          >. I miss the horizontal scroll wheel from the MX Master. This removes
          most of my hand pain, however it can occasionally introduce some new
          wrist or lower arm pain. I've been switching between this mouse and my
          MX Master.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keyboard:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SW1S3YZ"
            >KINESIS Gaming Freestyle Edge</a
          >. I haven't noticed a huge difference though between this and a
          traditional keyboard. I think the slight tenting has been a little
          more comfortable though. I do notice less hand pain. But hard to know
          what to attribute that to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keyboard Accessory:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077J7ZBM7"
            >KINESIS Lift Kit</a
          >. Needed to lift the KINESIS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Headphones:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756GB78C"
            >Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless</a
          >. Didn't think wireless would be that big of a deal, turns out its
          very nice. Is annoying to manage across multiple devices though. Noise
          cancelling is lovely on airplanes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Router:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5MPTG1"
            >Synology RT2600ac</a
          >. Was having internet connectivity issues in a 2 person home like
          poor streaming quality. Am no longer having those issues since this
          purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modem:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5MPTG1"
            >NETGEAR Cable Modem CM600 </a
          >. Had this forever, no problems that I've identified!
        </li>
        <li>
          Hub:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PVKHZLJ"
            >TBI Pro USB-C Hub 12-in-1</a
          >. Love it! Plug all my peripherals in here, and only need to plug one
          cord into my laptop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Webcam:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MTTMPKT"
            >Logitech C922 Pro Stream</a
          >. Lets me conference call with a fixed camera and mic. I find it
          convenient with a small desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Display:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display"
            >Apple 27" Thunderbolt Display</a
          >. Had this since 2012, I think they're discontinued now. Don't
          recommend it, but I do really enjoy the 27" monitor space in general!
        </li>
        <li>
          Desk:
          <a
            href="https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html"
            >Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk 36" x 27"</a
          >. Automatic standing desk is nice. Don't use it as much as when I
          first got it. Is useful to stand in the afternoons when sleepy after
          lunch. This desk is a little small. Not much additional room for
          non-computer stuff. Would get a bigger one if I had space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Desk Shelf/Monitor Raiser:
          <a href="https://www.fully.com/jarvis-desk-shelf.html"
            >Jarvis Desk Shelf</a
          >. Love this! Lets me put monitor above the laptop and have space for
          other accessories.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chair:
          <a
            href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair?option20=55"
            >Autonmous ErgoChair 2</a
          >. Not sure how I feel about this chair. It has a lot of adjustable
          features that I'm not sure I'm making the best use of. Its generally
          pretty comfortable though.
