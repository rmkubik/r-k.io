      <h1>Ryan Kubik Uses</h1>
      <p>A list of the equipment that I use in my home office:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mouse:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S395RWD"
            >Logitech MX Master 3</a
          >. I almost love this mouse. The horizontal scroll wheel is great.
          However, my pinky and ring fingers are smooshed together when holding
          the mouse. This has caused some discomfort for me so I do not solely
          use this mouse anymore. I've been switching between this mouse and my
          MX Vertical.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mouse:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FNJB8TT"
            >Logitech MX Vertical Wireless Mouse</a
          >. I miss the horizontal scroll wheel from the MX Master. This removes
          most of my hand pain, however it can occasionally introduce some new
          wrist or lower arm pain. I've been switching between this mouse and my
          MX Master.
        </li>
        <li>
          Mouse:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FNJB8TT"
            >Logitech MX Ergo Mouse</a
          >
          In my quest to try every MX Logitech mouse I picked up the MX Ergo as
          well. This one I mainly use while using my laptop on the couch or
          other places where dragging a mouse around is impractical. It took a
          bit to get used to, but not as long as I thought it was. I like it a
          lot. I'm not sure I would want to replace my MX Vertical for every day
          desk use though.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keyboard:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SW1S3YZ"
            >KINESIS Gaming Freestyle Edge</a
          >. I haven't noticed a huge difference though between this and a
          traditional keyboard. I think the slight tenting has been a little
          more comfortable though. I do notice less hand pain. But hard to know
          what to attribute that to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keyboard Accessory:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B077J7ZBM7"
            >KINESIS Lift Kit</a
          >. Needed to lift the KINESIS.
        </li>
        <li>
          Headphones:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B0756GB78C"
            >Bose QuietComfort 35 II Wireless</a
          >. Didn't think wireless would be that big of a deal, turns out its
          very nice. Is annoying to manage across multiple devices though. Noise
          cancelling is lovely on airplanes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Router:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5MPTG1"
            >Synology RT2600ac</a
          >. Was having internet connectivity issues in a 2 person home like
          poor streaming quality. Am no longer having those issues since this
          purchase.
        </li>
        <li>
          Modem:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N5MPTG1"
            >NETGEAR Cable Modem CM600 </a
          >. Had this forever, no problems that I've identified!
        </li>
        <li>
          Hub:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07CZPV8DF"
            >CalDigit TS3 Plus Thunderbolt 3 Dock</a
          >. When my previous hub died, I replaced it with this one that I'd
          seen recommended around the Internet. I had avoided it originally
          because it seemed a little overpriced. If this lasts me a two or three
          years it will be worth it compared to the other midrange dock.
          Thankfully, this dock is much smaller that I thought it looked on
          Amazon. Very easy to fit on my desk. It has all the ports I need, and
          no integrated cables that might break. Working well for the first 6
          months!
        </li>
        <li>
          Hub:
          <span class="strikethrough"
            ><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PVKHZLJ"
              >TBI Pro USB-C Hub 12-in-1</a
            >. Love it! Plug all my peripherals in here, and only need to plug
            one cord into my laptop.</span
          >
          This hub died on me after a year and a half-ish. I'd not recommend it
          any more. I'm unsure if I had a faulty one or not. Also, the link
          above used to link to the hub I purchased but now looks like an
          entirely different hub. Also, this dock had an integrated cable that
          may've been what broke, but I had no way to replace it.

        <li>
          Webcam:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MTTMPKT"
            >Logitech C922 Pro Stream</a
          >. Lets me conference call with a fixed camera and mic. I find it
          convenient with a small desktop.
        </li>
        <li>
          Display:
          <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07JQTNCGB"
            >Dell UltraSharp 27" USB-C Monitor (2719DC)</a
          >. A recent purchase (at time of writing) to replace my old
          Thunderbolt Display. Monitors have become so much smaller since 2012.
          Screen looks great. Stand is decent, if a little less attractive than
          the Thunderbolt (but infinitely cheaper). I've found myself missing
          the built in webcam and speakers a little bit so far.
        </li>
        <li class="strikethrough">
          Display:
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Thunderbolt_Display"
            >Apple 27" Thunderbolt Display</a
          >. Had this since 2012, I think they're discontinued now. It was great
          for a while. Now, It occasionally causes my laptop's kernel task to
          run at 500% until I unplug it for a while. Additionally, doesn't work
          with my Window's machine. I recommend it, but I do really enjoy the
          27" monitor space in general!
        </li>
        <li>
          Desk:
          <a
            href="https://www.fully.com/standing-desks/jarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo.html"
            >Jarvis Bamboo Standing Desk 36" x 27"</a
          >. Automatic standing desk is nice. Don't use it as much as when I
          first got it. Is useful to stand in the afternoons when sleepy after
          lunch. This desk is a little small. Not much additional room for
          non-computer stuff. Would get a bigger one if I had space.
        </li>
        <li>
          Desk Shelf/Monitor Raiser:
          <a href="https://www.fully.com/jarvis-desk-shelf.html"
            >Jarvis Desk Shelf</a
          >. Love this! Lets me put monitor above the laptop and have space for
          other accessories.
        </li>
        <li>
          Chair:
          <a
            href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair?option20=55"
            >Autonmous ErgoChair 2</a
          >. Not sure how I feel about this chair. It has a lot of adjustable
          features that I'm not sure I'm making the best use of. Its generally
          pretty comfortable though.
